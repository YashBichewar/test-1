	c)  git config --global user.name "YashBichewar"    (your username in git)
	     git config --global user.email yash14yash@gmail.com    (the username 	     you used to sign in)

4) git config –list (To check if the username and email id are added, if it doesn't work with one hyphen try adding two hyphens)

5) In the same folder create a file and write something in it.

6) After the file is created run → git add <filename>

7)To give a message with the file write → git commit -m <"Your message">

10) The above command will push your file to the git hub

11) To add a complete folder having multiple files to your git use → git add -A
